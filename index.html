    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am a highly accomplished professional with a Doctor of Engineering degree from the joint training program of Zhejiang University and UC Berkeley. I have been recognized as a top talent in various programs, such as the Shanghai Oriental Elite Top-notch Program, Shanghai Pujiang Talent Program, and a core talent of key enterprises in Shanghai. I am also a senior engineer specialized in AI.
      <br>
      With extensive experience in the fields of intelligent connected and autonomous driving as well as AI, I have been engaged in research and development in these areas for many years. I have in-depth knowledge of intelligent driving systems, decision-making, planning, and control modules, and am proficient in end-to-end intelligent driving technologies. I also have a profound understanding of intelligent driving simulation systems. In the AI field, I have actively explored and applied both traditional AI technologies like CNN, GCN, and reinforcement learning, and emerging generative AI technologies. I have rich experience in promoting the productization of AI technologies and have a deep understanding of the market needs and technological trends.
